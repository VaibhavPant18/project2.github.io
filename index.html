        <h2>Moist Tropical Forest</h2>
        <p>Where the amount of annual rainfall ranges between 200 and 250 cm, the mean annual temperature lies between
          24 and 27
          and humidity percentage is 80, the evergreen forests degenerate into semi evergreen forests; such forests are
          found
          along the Western Coast, in Upper Assam, lower slopes of the eastern Himalaya, Orissa coast and neighbouring
          hills.
          <br>
          Important plant varieties include bamboos, epiphytes, aini, semul, gutel, mundane, hopea, benteak, kadam irul,
          rosewood,
          haldu, kanju, bijasal, kusum, bomsum, Indian chestnut, litsea, holloch, champa and mesua, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Dry Tropical Forest</h2>
        <p>This types of forests mainly found in Indian Northern Hilly regions and some states of Southern India.
          Basically, these
          forests are generated where average annual rainfall ranges varies from 51 cm to 151. Trees of these forests
          drop its
          leaves in winter (when the weather remains driest) and new leaves are generated after winter. <br> During
          rainy
          season these
          types of forest completely decorate lush green leaves. Some significant trees of dry tropical forest are sal,
          acacia,
          mangoes and bamboo.</p>
        <h2>Montane Temperate Forest</h2>
        <p>These types of forests are mainly generated in Northern middle Himalayas ranges (1801 to 3001 m) and Southern
          Niligiri
          higher Mountain ranges. It takes about 201 cm average annual rainfalls to produce these types of forests. Some
          significant trees of montane temperate forest are rhododendrons, ferns, oak, maple, juniper, deodar, chilgoza,
          etc.</p>
        <h2>Montane Subtropical Forest</h2>
        <p>These types of forests mainly generated in the state of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Manipur,
          Arunachal Pradesh,
          etc. <br> mountain ranges of Western Ghats are also the abode of these types' forests. Some significant trees
          of
          montane sub
          tropical forest are poonspar, cinnamon, rhododendron, sal, sandan, laburnum, pomegranate, olive, oleander,
          etc.</p>
        <h2>Alpine Forest</h2>
        <p>These grasslands start at an elevation of above 3000 m grow up to the region just below the snowline. They
          are common in
          both the main Himalayan regions as well as the barren cold deserts of the Tran Himalaya. Low alpine grasslands
          are
          common with the vegetation not growing higher than 1.5m.
          Climatic conditions vary from the sub-arctic to arctic, with snow covering the ground for over 5 months a
          year. <br> The
          growing season for the plants is thus stunted. Pastures are grazed by migratory cattle in summer. <br> The
          vegetation
          consists mainly of the black juniper, the drooping juniper; honeysuckle and willow are the common trees.</p>
